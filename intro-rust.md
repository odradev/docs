# Rust programming language
## Long story short

Rust is a quite new systems programming language, which is developed by Mozilla.
It is fast, memory-efficient and, above all, it guarnteed memory safety. 
The memory is managed internally by Rust and it does not use a garbage collector.
That's why it affects the maintenance of high efficiency. 
It also offers the user: efficient C biding, minimal runtime, 
or trait-based generics.
