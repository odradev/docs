# Soolidity programming language
## Long story short

Solidity is a high-level programming, object-oriented programming language. 
It is mainly used for creating and implementing smart contracts on blockchains
like Ethereum. It is a statically typed language, 
so the user has to declare every variable. It reminds a lot of JavaScript, 
but it has also similarities with Python or C++. It also offers the user: 
complex user-defined programming, libraries, and inheritance. 
Private functions are only called from inside contracts.
